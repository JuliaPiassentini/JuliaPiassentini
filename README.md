## Hi there! I'm Julia 👋


🔭 I’m currently working on improving backend features at Madow Tech, including state machines, data validation, and API architecture using Node.js, Kurier, and PostgreSQL.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about AI integration in real-world projects and exploring tools like XState, Ember.js and automation workflows.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on backend projects, APIs, or anything involving Node.js, TypeScript, and database design.

🤔 I’m looking for help with applying AI in development workflows and exploring best practices for intelligent automations.

Fun fact: I enjoy playing with Arduino kits to create fun little projects
